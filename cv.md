## **About me**
I am 23 and  I work as a foreman in the woodworking workshop. I have good teamwork skills. This is my necessary first job after graduating university and it's coming to an end. I was looking for a new job for myself and came across rs school. I was interested in the job of Frontend Developer. I think that my curiosity and persistency will help me achieve high results in this area. My goal is to take more money and do something really interesting and useful.
